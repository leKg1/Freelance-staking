### TODOs

- Only display FreelanceToken

- Check who sees the smart contract (the owner and token holder?)

- If you have a contractAddress you could via standard web3 js lib ask the blockchain about name, symbol, totalSupply and balance instead!

-  If something is a FreelanceToken, we can also display totalStakes, ourStake

- When clicking on a ERC20Token (Smart Contract) project you can see all your invoices there and start writing new invoices

- Send Invoices by email

- Show Open Invoices 

- Show Paid Invoices
